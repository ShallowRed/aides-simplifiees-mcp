# 🔮 Next Steps & Follow-Up Guide

This guide outlines what you need to do to continue developing and using the MCP agent.

---

## 🚀 Immediate Actions (Today)

### 1. **Test the Tools** ✅

Try each tool to verify they work:

```bash
# Test domain linter (should work immediately on this repo)
npm run lint:domain

# Test GitHub analyzer (will clone and analyze the repo)
npm run dev:cli analyze-repo betagouv aides-simplifiees-app

# Test architecture analyzer
npm run dev:cli analyze-arch betagouv aides-simplifiees-app
```

**Expected output**: You should see detailed reports for each command.

### 2. **Configure MCP Client** (Optional)

If you want to use this with Claude Desktop:

1. Open: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add this configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aides-simplifiees": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/lucaspoulain/aides-simplifiees-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop

4. Test by asking: "What tools do you have available?"

### 3. **Push to GitHub** ✅

```bash
# Add remote (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/betagouv/aides-simplifiees-mcp.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

This will activate the GitHub Actions workflows automatically.

## 📅 Short-Term (This Week)

### 1. **Gather Real-World Data**

Run the analyzer on your actual repositories to get baseline metrics:

```bash
# Analyze main app
npm run dev:cli analyze-repo betagouv aides-simplifiees-app > reports/app-analysis.txt

# Analyze docs
npm run dev:cli analyze-repo betagouv aides-simplifiees-docs > reports/docs-analysis.txt

# Check architecture health
npm run dev:cli analyze-arch betagouv aides-simplifiees-app > reports/architecture.txt
```

**Goal**: Understand the current state of your codebase.

### 2. **Review Architecture Issues**

Look at the architecture report and identify:
- Components with high coupling
- Duplicated code that should be shared
- Overly complex functions
- Circular dependencies

**Decision point**: What should we prioritize for refactoring?

### 3. **Customize Domain Rules**

Edit `domain-rules.json` to match your actual conventions:
- Add more auto-mappings for legacy IDs
- Adjust enum normalization rules
- Add project-specific validation rules

### 4. **Test on Pull Requests**

Create a test PR in your repository to verify:
- GitHub Actions run correctly
- Reports are generated
- PR comments are posted
- Violations are caught

---

## 🎯 Medium-Term (Next 2-3 Weeks)

### 1. **Implement Doc-Code Sync Validator**

**What it needs**:
- Access to your docs repository
- Logic to parse Markdown and extract API documentation
- Comparison between documented vs implemented APIs
- Report generation

**I can help with**: Writing this tool if you provide:
- Sample documentation files
- Your documentation structure/format
- What you want to validate

### 2. **Implement Figma Integration**

**What it needs**:
- Figma API access token (get from: figma.com/developers)
- Your Figma file ID(s)
- Mapping logic for Figma → code components
- Field ID validation rules

**I can help with**: Writing this tool if you provide:
- Figma access token (store in `.env` file)
- Figma file IDs for your simulators
- Naming conventions for Figma components

### 3. **Build Recommendation Engine**

**What it does**:
- Aggregates findings from all tools
- Prioritizes issues by impact and effort
- Generates specific, actionable suggestions
- Tracks improvements over time

**I can help with**: Implementing this based on what you learn from the architecture reports.

### 4. **Create Unified Dashboard**

**What it does**:
- Combines all reports into one view
- Shows overall project health
- Tracks metrics over time
- Exports to visualization tools

**I can help with**: Building this once the other tools are complete.

## 🔧 Configuration Needed

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for sensitive data:

```bash
# Figma API (optional, for Figma sync tool)
FIGMA_TOKEN=your-figma-token-here

# GitHub token (optional, for private repos)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token-here
```

**Note**: Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already done).

### Domain Rules

Edit `domain-rules.json` as your conventions evolve:
- Add new auto-mappings
- Update enum normalizations
- Adjust validation thresholds

### Glossary

Keep `domain/glossaire.yml` up to date:
- Add new domain terms
- Document field definitions
- Update canonical slugs

---

## 📊 What to Monitor

### 1. **Linting Violations**

Track these over time:
- Number of violations per PR
- Most common violation types
- Time to fix violations

**Goal**: Reduce violations to zero.

### 2. **Architecture Health Score**

Monitor the 0-100 health score:
- Current baseline: ?/100 (run analyzer to find out)
- Target: 80+/100
- Track improvements after refactorings

### 3. **Code Duplication**

Measure duplicate code:
- Number of duplication instances
- Lines of duplicated code
- Components that should be extracted

**Goal**: Reduce duplication by 50%.

### 4. **Coupling Metrics**

Watch for high-coupling components:
- Instability scores > 0.7
- Components with >10 dependencies
- Circular dependency cycles

**Goal**: Break up tightly coupled modules.

## 🤝 When You Need Help

### Questions to Ask Me

1. **"How do I implement the doc-sync validator?"**
   - I'll need: sample docs, your structure, validation requirements

2. **"Can you add Figma integration?"**
   - I'll need: Figma token, file IDs, naming conventions

3. **"The analyzer found issues, what should I do?"**
   - Share the report, I'll help prioritize and suggest fixes

4. **"How do I customize the rules?"**
   - Tell me what you want to validate, I'll update the rules

5. **"Can you add support for [framework]?"**
   - Let me know what framework, I'll add detection/analysis

### Providing Context

When asking for help, share:
- The specific report/output you're seeing
- What you want to achieve
- Any constraints or requirements
- Sample files if relevant

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know this is working well when:

✅ **PRs are automatically validated** for domain conventions
✅ **Architecture issues are caught** before merge
✅ **Code quality improves** over time (health score goes up)
✅ **Team follows conventions** (fewer violations)
✅ **Refactorings are data-driven** (based on metrics)
✅ **Documentation stays in sync** with code
✅ **Design matches implementation** (Figma ↔ code)

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

Current limitations to be aware of:

1. **Node.js Only**: Currently only analyzes JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Future: Could add Python, Go, etc.

2. **GitHub Only**: Only works with GitHub repositories
   - Future: Could add GitLab, Bitbucket support

3. **No YAML Linting**: Domain linter only handles JSON
   - Future: Add YAML parsing support

4. **Basic Duplication Detection**: Uses simple string similarity
   - Future: Add token-based/AST-based duplication detection

5. **No Performance Metrics**: Doesn't track runtime performance
   - Future: Add bundle size, load time analysis

---

## 💬 Final Thoughts

You now have a **working foundation** that:
- ✅ Validates domain conventions
- ✅ Analyzes code architecture
- ✅ Detects quality issues
- ✅ Integrates with CI/CD

The next phase is to:
1. **Use it** on real PRs and projects
2. **Learn** from the reports and metrics
3. **Iterate** on the rules and thresholds
4. **Expand** with the remaining tools

**I'm here to help!** Just ask when you're ready to implement the next tool or need assistance with configuration.

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs**: Look at terminal output for errors
2. **Verify configuration**: Ensure `domain-rules.json` is valid
3. **Test incrementally**: Start with one tool at a time
4. **Ask for help**: Share the error message and context

**Happy coding!** 🚀
